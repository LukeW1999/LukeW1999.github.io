# About
Hi, I'm a software engineer. I'm interested in software security and AI.

I'm currently doing my Phd in System and Software Security at [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

I share some paper notes here and some study notes there.

I try to record my research as well but I am not sure if I should share it here.
